\section{Sudoku Variants}

A standard Sudoku is a $9$ by $9$ grid. It is divided into $3$ by $3$ squares. The cells are filled with $1$ through $9$, and digits cannot repeat in columns, rows, and $3$ by $3$ squares. 

A Sudoku XV follows all standard Sudoku rules, but has the letters X or V on lines. If one of these is present, the two cells on the line add to $10$ if X and $5$ if V. If no X and no V, the cells do not add to $10$ or $5$. 

An inequality Sudoku follows all standard Sudoku rules, but has inequality signs on some lines. It shows which of the two cells is less.
